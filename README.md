# Net Metabolic Power & Step Length Asymmetry Analysis 🏃‍♂️📊

## Overview
This repository contains an **R-based split-belt adaptation analysis pipeline** 
The script:
- Computes **resting metabolic rate (RMR)** from a standing trial.
- Estimates **walking net metabolic power** using the Peronnet & Massicotte equation.
- Computes **step length asymmetry (SLA)** based on treadmill perturbations.

## Usage
- Required package: `dplyr`  
- Update `metabolic_data.csv` with your file path.
