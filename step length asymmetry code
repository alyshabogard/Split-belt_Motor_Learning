# The data is exported from Visual3D as a cell array
# Left step lengths are stored in: data{1,1}{1,1}
# Right step lengths are stored in: data {1,2}{1,1}

# Step length asymmetry (SLA) is calculated as the fast step lengths - slow step lengths / fast step lengths + slow step lengths
# Therefore, SLA will be calculated based on which leg was perturbed during the experiment

# Select Fast Leg for Data Analysis
# Type 1 in the console if the left treadmill belt was sped up or type 2 if the right treadmill belt was sped up
fprintf('Is the fast leg the left leg (1) or right leg (2)?\n');
choice=input(' ');

# If the right leg was selected, it will calculate the following script:
if choice==2
    sla = (data{1,2}{1,1}-data{1,1}{1,1})./(data{1,1}{1,1}+data{1,2}{1,1});

# Otherwise, it will calculate this script:
elseif choice==1
    sla = (data{1,1}{1,1}-data{1,2}{1,1})./(data{1,1}{1,1}+data{1,2}{1,1});
